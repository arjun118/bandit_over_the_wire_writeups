login using ssh and change directory to "inhere"
you will find 10 files.

text from the website:
>The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory

human readable indicated ASCII format

get the file types of all the 10 files using file command

```bash
file ./*
```

you will see there is only one ASCII file and that holds your pass
