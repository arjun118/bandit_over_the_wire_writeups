so basically all the steps remain the same from the previous level..

now in the readme.md file that is present in the repo we get after cloning we don't have the pass rather we have x's


let's look at the logs

```shell
git log
```

after seeing the commit messages i was a little interesed what changes exactly happened in those commits

so I asked google how to do that

[you can read this to know exaclty how to do that](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-view-commit-history-with-git-log/)

```shell
git log -p
```

you will get the pass for next level
